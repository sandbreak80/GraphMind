# EminiPlayer QA Automation Rules

## Test Requirements
- All new features must include unit tests
- All API changes must include integration tests
- All user workflows must include e2e tests
- Test coverage must be >80%
- All tests must pass before merge

## Test Execution
- Run tests automatically on every change
- Run full test suite on pull requests
- Run performance tests on main branch
- Run security scans on all changes

## Test Quality
- Tests must be deterministic and reliable
- Tests must clean up after themselves
- Tests must not depend on external services
- Tests must be fast and efficient

## Test Documentation
- All test files must have docstrings
- Complex test logic must be commented
- Test data must be clearly documented
- Test failures must be actionable

## Automated Actions
- On code change: Run unit tests
- On pull request: Run full test suite
- On merge to main: Run performance tests
- On deployment: Run security scans
- On test failure: Block merge/deployment

## Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript for frontend code
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints for Python
- Use meaningful variable names

## Documentation
