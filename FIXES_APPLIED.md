# GraphMind Fixes Applied - Oct 25, 2025

## Summary
This document details all fixes applied to GraphMind to resolve user-reported issues and improve system functionality.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Password Change Functionality
**Issue**: Users had no way to change their password after initial login.

**Fix**:
- Created `/change-password` page with secure form
- Added backend endpoint `/auth/change-password` with validation
- Implemented `change_password()` method in `AuthManager`
- Added navigation link in Sidebar
- Enforces minimum 6 character password requirement
- Validates current password before allowing change

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/change-password/page.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts` (new)
- `app/auth.py` - Added `change_password()` method
- `app/main.py` - Added `/auth/change-password` endpoint
- `frontend/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added "Change Password" link

---

### 2. Removed Default Credentials from Login Page
**Issue**: Login page displayed default admin credentials, which is a security concern.

**Fix**:
- Removed the display of "Default credentials: admin/admin123" from login form
- Users must know credentials to log in

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/components/LoginForm.tsx`

---

### 3. GraphMind Header Navigation
**Issue**: Clicking "GraphMind" in header created a new chat instead of going home.

**Fix**:
- Changed header link behavior to navigate to homepage (`/`)
- Updated tooltip from "Click to start a new chat" to "Go to homepage"

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/components/Header.tsx`

---

### 4. Standardized Typography
**Issue**: Font sizes, families, and weights were inconsistent across the application.

**Fix**:
- Set Inter as default font family with system fallbacks
- Standardized base font size to 14px (0.875rem)
- Defined consistent heading sizes:
  - h1: 20px
  - h2: 18px
  - h3: 16px
  - h4-h6: 14px
- Applied consistent line heights
- Standardized font weights across all components
- Added antialiasing for better text rendering

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Added font family and size definitions
- `frontend/app/globals.css` - Added typography rules
- `frontend/components/MessageBubble.tsx` - Reduced font size to text-xs

---

### 5. Web Search Refusal Fix
**Issue**: Web search returned sources but responded with "I can't fulfill this request" due to model being overly cautious.

**Fix**:
- Rewrote `web_search_only` system prompt to be more directive
- Added explicit instructions: "You MUST provide a helpful answer"
- Added: "Never refuse to answer - always provide the best response possible"
- Changed tone from "market analyst" to "research assistant" to reduce refusal triggers
- More general-purpose prompt suitable for any query type

**Files Modified**:
- `app/system_prompt_manager.py` - Updated `web_search_only` default prompt

---

### 6. Document Upload to Backend
**Issue**: Document upload saved files to frontend `public/uploads` instead of backend documents directory for RAG ingestion.

**Fix**:
- Modified frontend upload route to proxy files to backend
- Added backend `/upload` endpoint that saves to `/workspace/documents`
- Files now properly saved for ingestion into ChromaDB
- Generates unique filenames with timestamp prefix

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts` - Changed to proxy to backend
- `app/main.py` - Added `/upload` endpoint with `UploadFile` handling

---

### 7. Research Model Configuration Fix
**Issue**: Comprehensive research mode failed with "404 Client Error" because it tried to use non-existent model `gpt-oss:20b`.

**Fix**:
- Changed `RESEARCH_LLM_MODEL` from `gpt-oss:20b` to `qwen2.5:14b`
- Model now exists in Ollama and is available for research queries

**Files Modified**:
- `app/config.py` - Updated `RESEARCH_LLM_MODEL` default value

---

### 8. Login Navigation
**Issue**: Login attempted to create/navigate to a chat, which could fail.

**Fix**:
- Simplified login flow to stay on homepage
- `AuthWrapper` now properly renders homepage interface after authentication
- No automatic chat creation on login
- Removed conditional chat navigation logic from `page.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Simplified to just render `AuthWrapper`
- Login now naturally stays on the homepage

---

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Import Organization
- Added `File` and `UploadFile` to FastAPI imports in `app/main.py`
- Removed duplicate imports from upload function

### Error Handling
- Improved error messages in upload endpoint
- Added better logging for uploaded files

### Code Quality
- Removed redundant code
- Simplified component logic
- Improved function documentation

---

## üìã Remaining Items

### System Prompts Management
**Status**: In Progress  
**Issue**: Need to verify saving/editing functionality works correctly

**Next Steps**:
1. Test system prompt updates via UI
2. Verify prompts persist across restarts
3. Validate prompt versioning system

---

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Test Script
Created `test_all_fixes.py` to validate:
1. Authentication and login
2. Password change functionality
3. Document upload to backend
4. System prompts management
5. Web search without refusal
6. Comprehensive research mode
7. Ollama model availability
8. Documents management endpoints

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 test_all_fixes.py
```

**Note**: Backend takes 30-60 seconds to fully start (loading embedding models). If tests fail with connection errors, wait and re-run.

---

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

- Backend startup time: 30-60 seconds (embedding model loading)
- Frontend build size: 554 kB (optimized)
- All routes properly configured (28 API routes + 5 pages)
- Static pages pre-rendered where appropriate
- Dynamic routes for authenticated content

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- Default credentials no longer displayed (users must know them)
- Password change requires current password validation
- Minimum 6 character password requirement
- All authenticated endpoints require valid JWT token
- File uploads authenticated and validated
- Documents stored in backend-only accessible directory

---

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check backend logs: `docker logs graphmind-rag`
2. Check frontend logs: `docker logs graphmind-frontend`
3. Run test suite: `python3 test_all_fixes.py`
4. Verify all services: `docker compose -f docker-compose.graphmind.yml ps`
5. Restart services: `docker compose -f docker-compose.graphmind.yml restart`
