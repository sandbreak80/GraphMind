- Login instant regardless of ingestion

**Result:**
- Login always responsive
- No blocking during document processing

---

### ✅ RAG Source Citations Show "rag-only 0" - FIXED
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Fixed**: October 25, 2025

**Solution Implemented:**

### ✅ Security Vulnerabilities in Upload - FIXED
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Fixed**: October 25, 2025

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **File Type Validation**: Whitelist only processable types
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Return HTTP 409 for existing files
3. **Size Enforcement**: 400MB max, enforced during streaming
4. **Streaming Validation**: Check size incrementally, delete partial files

**Result:**
- No unsupported file types accepted
- No duplicate file overwrites
- Size limits properly enforced

## 🟢 P1 - High Priority Issues (ALL RESOLVED - Oct 30, 2025)

### 1. ✅ Dark Mode Toggle Not Working - RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: Was P1 (High)  
**Impact**: UI/UX

**Description:**
Dark mode toggle in header didn't properly switch theme. Users clicking the dark mode toggle saw no visual change.

**Root Causes:**
- Theme class not reactively applied to document root
- No effect hook watching theme state changes
- ThemeScript not properly reading persisted store

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `useEffect` in Providers to watch theme state and apply to DOM
2. Enhanced ThemeScript to read from zustand persist storage
3. Cleaned up ThemeToggle component logic
4. Removed duplicate theme functions

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/app/providers.tsx` - Added theme effect hook
- `frontend/components/ThemeScript.tsx` - Enhanced persistence
- `frontend/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Cleaned up logic
- `frontend/components/Header.tsx` - Removed duplicates

**Validation**: Manual testing recommended
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

---

### 2. ✅ Chat Deletion on Open Chat Logs Out User - RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: Was P1 (High)  
**Impact**: User Experience

**Description:**
When users deleted the currently open/active chat, they were logged out instead of being redirected to the home page.

**Root Cause:**
- `window.location.href = '/'` caused full page reload
- Full reload sometimes lost authentication state

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated delete button to use Next.js router for client-side navigation
2. Added detection: if deleting current chat, navigate first then delete
3. Removed `window.location.href` from store's deleteChat function
4. 100ms delay allows navigation to complete before deletion

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Smart delete navigation
- `frontend/lib/store.ts` - Removed page reload

**Validation**: Manual testing recommended
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

---

### 3. ✅ System Prompt Changes Sometimes Don't Persist - RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: Was P1 (High)  
**Impact**: Functionality

**Description:**
System prompt edits sometimes didn't persist after page refresh or service restart. Intermittent issue suggesting race condition.

**Root Causes:**
1. Backend returned full object instead of prompt string
2. No explicit file flush/sync (buffer delays)
3. Frontend used POST instead of PUT

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Fixed `get_user_prompt()` to extract prompt string from nested object
2. Added `f.flush()` and `os.fsync()` to ensure immediate disk write
3. Changed frontend to use PUT method matching API
4. Added verification reload after save

**Files Modified:**
- `app/user_prompt_manager.py` - String extraction + fsync
- `frontend/app/prompts/page.tsx` - PUT method + verification

**Validation**: ✅ **API TESTS PASSED** (7/7 tests)
- All 4 modes tested and working
- Persistence verified after delays
- Reset functionality working

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** (Fully Validated)

## 🟢 P2 - Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Markdown Rendering Could Be Improved

**Status**: 🟢 Medium Priority  
**Severity**: P2 (Medium)  
**Impact**: UI Polish

**Description:**
Markdown rendering in chat responses has minor formatting issues:
- Line breaks sometimes inconsistent
- Code blocks could have better syntax highlighting
- Tables occasionally misaligned
- Lists sometimes have spacing issues

**Root Cause:**
- Using `react-markdown` with basic config
- Need better `remarkGfm` and `rehypeRaw` settings
- CSS styles for markdown elements could be refined

**Workaround:**
Responses are readable, just not perfectly formatted.

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Review `react-markdown` configuration
2. Add custom CSS for markdown elements
3. Test with various markdown samples
4. Consider switching to `marked` or `markdown-it` if needed

**Files Affected:**
- `frontend/components/EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`
- Markdown rendering configuration
- CSS styles for `.prose` classes

**Priority Justification:**
- Cosmetic issue
- Doesn't block functionality
- Can be improved incrementally
- Low user impact

### 5. Memory Loading Slow on Large Datasets

**Status**: 🟢 Medium Priority  
**Severity**: P2 (Medium)  
**Impact**: Performance

**Description:**
When memory system contains large amounts of data (>1000 entries), loading the memory page takes 5-10 seconds.

**Root Cause:**
- Loading all memory categories at once
- No pagination or lazy loading
- JSON file reading not optimized
- Frontend not caching memory data

**Workaround:**
Wait for page to load, then it's responsive.

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Add pagination to memory API (50 items per page)
2. Implement lazy loading for categories
3. Cache memory data in frontend state
4. Only reload when changes detected
5. Consider switching to SQLite for memory storage

**Files Affected:**
- `frontend/app/memory/page.tsx`
- `app/memory_system.py`
- Memory API endpoints

**Priority Justification:**
- Only affects users with large memory datasets
- One-time load per session
- Functionality still works
- Can optimize later

---

### 6. Model List Refresh Delay

**Status**: 🟢 Medium Priority  
**Severity**: P2 (Medium)  
**Impact**: UX Polish

**Description:**
After clicking "Refresh Models" in the model selector, there's a noticeable delay (2-3 seconds) before the list updates.

**Root Cause:**
- Fetching from Ollama API (slow)
- No loading indicator during refresh
- No caching of model list
- Frontend waits for full response

**Workaround:**
Wait a few seconds, models will update.

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Add loading spinner during refresh
2. Cache model list (5 min TTL)
3. Fetch in background, update UI when ready
4. Show last-fetched timestamp

**Files Affected:**
- `frontend/components/ChatControls.tsx`
- Model selector component
- Ollama API client

**Priority Justification:**
- Minor UX issue
- Infrequent user action
- Easy fix (add spinner)
- Low impact
