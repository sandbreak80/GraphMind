## üêõ Critical Issues

### Dark Mode Not Working
**Status**: OPEN  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Frontend UI  
**Description**: Dark mode toggle button does not apply dark theme to the interface. The theme state is being managed correctly in the store, but the CSS classes are not being applied to the DOM elements.

**Symptoms**:
- Theme toggle button cycles through states (Light ‚Üí Dark ‚Üí System)
- Store state updates correctly
- DOM classes are not being applied to elements
- Interface remains in light mode regardless of theme selection

**Technical Details**:
- Theme script runs and applies classes to document root
- Zustand store manages theme state correctly
- Tailwind CSS configuration is correct (`darkMode: 'class'`)
- Issue appears to be with CSS class application to child elements

**Attempted Fixes**:
- Added theme script to prevent FOUC
- Enhanced theme toggle with 3-state cycling
- Added DOM class management with data attributes
- Implemented localStorage persistence
- Added system theme detection

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate Tailwind CSS dark mode class application
- Check if CSS classes are being overridden by other styles
- Verify theme classes are being applied to all components
- Consider using CSS custom properties for theme switching

**Files Affected**:
- `frontend/lib/store.ts` - Theme state management
- `frontend/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Theme toggle component
- `frontend/components/ThemeScript.tsx` - Theme initialization
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Theme script injection
